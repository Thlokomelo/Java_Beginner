What Is Object-Oriented Programming?

- object-oriented programming is a type of computer programming based on the premise that all programs are essentially 
  computer-based simulations of real-world objects or abstract concepts. For example:

» Flight-simulator programs attempt to mimic the behavior of real airplanes.
» Many computer games are simulations of actual games that humans play, such as baseball, NASCAR racing, and chess.
» Business programs can be thought of as simulations of business processes — such as order taking, customer service, 
  shipping, and billing.
