Programming features that are designed to handle similar types of objects: 

- Inheritance: Object-oriented programming technique that lets you use one class as the basis for another.

» The existing class is called the base class, superclass, or parent class;» the new class that’s derived from it is called the derived class, sub class, or child class.
» When you create a subclass, the subclass is automatically given all the methods
  and fields defined by its superclass.
» You can use these methods and fields as is, or you can override them to alter their behavior
» In addition, you can add methods and fields that define data and behavior that’s unique to the subclass.

- Interfaces: A set of public method and field declarations that are given a name.

» It is a set of methods and fields that a class must provide to implement the interface.


NB: A class can have only one base class, but a class can implement as many
    interfaces as necessary.
