Three layered approach to designing a program with objects:

1. Presentation:
   - The objects in this layer handle all the direct interaction with users. 
     For example, the HTML pages in a web application go in this layer.

2. Logic:
   - The objects in this layer represent the core objects of the application.
     For example, in a typical business-type application, this layer includes objects that
     represent business entities such as customer, products, orders, suppliers etc.

3. Database:
   - The objects in this layer handle all the details of interacting with whatever form of data
     storage is used by the application. If the data is stored in a SQL database, for example, 
     the objects in this layer handle all the SQL.
