Diagramming Classes with UML

- Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, 
  modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended 
  to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

- Class diagrams: used to illustarte the relationships among the classes that 
  make up an application. 

You can sub-divide the rectangle into two or three compartments that can contain additional
information about the class. The middle compartment of a class lists the class variables, 
whereas the bottom compartment lists the class methods.

- Drawing arrows: 
  Besides using rectangles to represent classes, class diagrams include arrows to represent 
  relationships among classes.
