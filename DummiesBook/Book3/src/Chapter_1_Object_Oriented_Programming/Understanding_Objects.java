What are Objects?

- both in the real world and in the world of programming — are entities that have
  certain basic characteristics.

Charaacteristics of Objects:

- Objects have Identity

For example:
every occurrence of a particular type of object — called an instance — can be distinguished
from every other occurrence of the same type of object, as well as from objects of other types.

Another Example:
If you have multiple invoices, each invoice can be identified by a unique invoice number.

NB: 
 » Each object has its own location in the computer’s memory.
 » The address of the starting location for an object provides a way of distinguishing one object 
   from another, because no two objects can occupy the same location in memory.
 » Java objects have something called a hash code, the hash code for an object is based on
   the object’s memory address.

- Objects have Type

 » object-oriented programming lets you assign names to the different kinds of objects in a program.
 » In Java, types are defined by classes.

Example: Statement creates an object of type Invoice

            Invoice i = new Invoice();
