Working with members

Members of a class are fields and methods defined in the class body.

- Understanding fields

  » A field is a variable that’s defined in the body of a class, outside any of the class’s
    methods. Fields, which are also called class variables, are available to all the methods
    of a class.

  »  If field specifies the public keyword: field is visible outside the class.
  »  If field specifies the private keyword: field not visible outside the class.

     Examples of public and private field declarations:

     public int trajectory = 0;
     public String name;
     public Player player;

     private int x_position = 0;
     private int y_position = 0;
     private String error-message = ""; 

  » Fields can also be declared as Final:

    public final int MAX_SCORE = 1000;  

    NB: (Field cant be changed, customary to spell Final field names in 
         all capital letters, but not reauired)
