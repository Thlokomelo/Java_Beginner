Understanding Static Fields and Methods

- It’s used to describe a special type of field or method that isn’t associated with a particular
  instance of a class. Instead, static fields and methods are associated with the class itself, which means that
  you don’t have to create an instance of the class to access a static field or methods.

- It is accessed by specifying the class name, not a variable that references an object.

- Common uses of static fields:

 » To provide constants or other values that aren’t related to class instances.
 » To keep count of how many instances of a class have been created.
 » In a business application, to keep track of a reference or serial number
   that’s assigned to each new object instance.
 » To provide an alternative way to create instances of the class.
 » To provide utility functions that aren’t associated with an object at all: A
   good example in the Java API library is the class, which provides a bunch Math
   of static methods to do math calculations.
