Solving Homework Problems with Arrays
-------------------------------------

Example: Problem Scenario

Bobo (these problems always had a character named Bobo in them) visits the local
high school on a Saturday and finds that all the school’s 1,000 lockers are neatly
closed. So he starts at one end of the school and opens them al. Then he goes
back to the start and closes every other locker (lockers 2, 4, 6, and so on). Then he
goes back to the start and hits every third locker: If it’s open, he closes it; if it’s
closed, he opens it. Then he hits every fourth locker, every fifth locker, and so on.
He keeps doing this all weekend long, walking the hallways opening and closing
lockers 1,000 times. Then he gets bored and goes home. How many of the school’s
1,000 lockers are left open, and which ones are they?

see BoboAndTheLockers class as a solution
