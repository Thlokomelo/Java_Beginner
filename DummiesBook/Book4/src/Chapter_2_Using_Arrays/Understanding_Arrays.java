Understanding Arrays
--------------------

» An array is a set of variables that is referenced by using a single variable name
  combined with an index number. Each item of an array is called an element. 
» All the elements in an array must be of the same type. Thus the array itself has a type
  that specifies what kind of elements it can contain. An int array can contain int values, for example, 
  and a String array can contain strings.


Some information on arrays:

» An array is itself an object. You can refer to the array object as a whole, rather
  than to a specific element of the array, by using the array’s variable name without
  an index. Thus, if x[5]refers to an element of an array, x refers to the array itself.

» An array has a fixed length that’s set when the array is created. This length
  determines the number of elements that can be stored in the array. The maximum
  index value you can use with any array is one less than the array’s length.
  Thus, if you create an array of ten elements, you can use index values from 0 to 9.

» You can’t change the length of an array after you create the array.

» You can access the length of an array by using the length field of the array
  variable. x.length, for example, returns the length of the array x.
