Using Recursion
---------------

Recursion is a basic programming technique in which a method calls itself to
solve some problem.

Calculating the Classic Factorial Example
-----------------------------------------

Example: The factorial of any given integer i.e. n, is the product of all the integers from 1 to n.
         Therefore the factorial of 5 is 120, that is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1.

The nonrecursive solution
-------------------------

see NonRecursive class as an example.

The recursive solution
----------------------

The recursive solution is based on the notion that the factorial for any number n
is equal to n times the factorial of n – 1, provided that n is greater than 1. If n is 1,
the factorial of n is 1.

see Recursive class as an example.


Displaying Directories
----------------------

See DirList Class as an example.



Using the sort, partition and swap methods
------------------------------------------
