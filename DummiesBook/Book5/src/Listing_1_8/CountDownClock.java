Program creates an instance of the CountDownClock class

The resulting output is an unpredictable mishmash of two threadsâ€™ outputs, with
some of the counts duplicated and others skipped altogether.

The two threads execute their loops simultaneously, so after one thread displays
its T minus 20, the other thread displays its own T minus 20. The same thing
happens for T minus 19, T minus 18, and so on.
