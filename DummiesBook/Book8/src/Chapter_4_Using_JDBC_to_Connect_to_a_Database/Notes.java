JDBC — Java Database Connectivity — is a Java feature that lets you connect to
almost any relational database system, execute SQL commands, and process
the results, all from within a Java program.


Setting Up a Driver
-------------------

Before you can write a Java program to access a database via JDBC, you must
first install a driver that links Java’s database API classes to an actual database.

www.mysql.com/products/connector and click the link for JDBC Driver for MySQL (Connector/J).

Connecting to a Database
------------------------

see postgresql database as an example.
